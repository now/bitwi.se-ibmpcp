`IBMPCP` README
===============

Introduction
------------

`IBMPCP` is a set of two fixed-width fonts, one 5 by 10 and one 7 by 10 in
size (width/height).  They have been designed to be as readable as possible
while being compact and small.  They are 'not' recommended for using for long
editing sessions, as they may result in severe eye-strain as 5 pixels by 10
pixels isn’t very largish.  I personally don’t use them anymore, as they are
too small for my bad sight.  They are however very nice, crisp, and
well designed, so I hope that they may be of use to at least some of the
terminal buffs out there.  Seeing as there probably aren’t that many of those
out there with 20/20 vision, that may be hoping for too much `;-)`.

Not much news.  The fonts are hopefully bug-free and in a state of finality.
