Installation of `IBMPCP`
========================

Configuration
-------------

The `Makefile` is set up to install the fonts into `/usr/share/fonts/ibmpcp` by
default.  This may be a problem if you don’t have access to the root account
for installing into this folder, so you might want to alter the 'fontsdir'
variable in the `Makefile`.  Everything else should work out of the box.  If it
doesn’t, just poke around in the `Makefile`.  This shouldn’t prove be too
difficult, seeing as how there really isn’t very much in there.

Installation
------------

To install `IBMPCP` using `sudo(1)` all you need to do is the following:

-----------------------------
% make
⋮
% sudo make install
Password:<type root password>
⋮
-----------------------------

at a shell prompt, and you’re done.  Alternatively you may use `su(1)` if
you’re system doesn’t include `sudo(1)`:

------------------------------
% make
⋮
% su
Password: <type root password>
# make install
⋮
# exit
------------------------------

You may of course use the `-c` switch to `su(1)` to run `make install`
immediately, but then you might as well be using `sudo(1)` `;-)`.
